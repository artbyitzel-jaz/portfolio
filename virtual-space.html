        <h1>Water Space</h1>
        <p>This is a virtual space I made on New Art City. For my space, I wanted to create cohesive dream-like scenes with three songs I picked out. I knew I wanted to focus my space on water, so I added sea animals, and I tried keeping a similar color palette between objects. The whispy tentacles seemed very flowy, so I added a song by PinkPantheress: Ophelia that features a harp and is also based on Ophelia from Macbeth, who drowned (water). Above the jellyfish, there is a party vibe going on to contrast the story from below, so I added an upbeat song: Feelings, also by PinkPantheress. If you follow the cherry blossoms away from this scene, you'll find a hello kitty stuffed animal and some toy-like foods, accompanied by the song Sienna from The Marias. These objects represent childhood, and correlate to her song that talks about a daughter she never had. This song also reminded me of water because of her cover art for her album Submarine. </p>
